<h1>RSS News Reader</h1>
<p>Interested in keeping up with the headlines and newspapers? An Internet system called <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> or Atom lets you do it easily. Websites provide "feeds" of their latest stories and headlines, and you can get these simple lists, updated every few minutes. If you want to know more about a story you can go straight to its webpage on its website and read it. No navigating difficult website and trying to spot what's changed!</p>

<h2>Getting RSS News Reader</h2>
<p>RSS News Reader is free. You can get it from the link below. You have to run the MSI file that you get from the link, and everything will be installed for you. You will then have a desktop shortcut called "RSS News Reader" you can use to start the program. You can also find "RSS News Reader" in your Start menu. You may also need to install the Microsoft .NET 4 Client Framework - I'll upload a proper installer soon.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="RSSNewsReader3.msi">Installer for RSS News Reader</a> Run this Windows Installer file to install RSS News Reader.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use, just cursor up and down your chosen feeds, press enter, and cursor up and down the items. A handy note plays if you reach the end of a list. No mouse required.</li>
<li>Supports RSS, all flavours, and Atom feeds.</li>
<li>Handles (very common) broken and invalid feeds so you always see the feed come up.</li>
<li>Add your own feeds so just the news and websites you want are there. Feed autodiscovery is also supported, so you just need the website address of your favourite site.</li>
<li>Feed list is automatically sorted into alphabetical order so you can access the feed you want quickly. Items are shown in date order so you don't get confused.</li>
<li>Hide or show read items with a keystroke so you know just what's new.</li>
<li>Save and load industry-standard OPML files so you can share your feeds or distribute them to other people or use someone else's collection of feeds.</li>
<li>It works with every screenreader, from Thunder and NVDA through to JAWS and WindowEyes. It even works with the built-in Windows Narrator!</li>
<li>It uses big, clear 16pt text so people with a little sight can use it without needing a screenreader at all.</li>
<li>You don't need to be an administrator to install it, and it automatically updates itself, so you don't need to know much to keep it running - I'll take care of all of that from the WebbIE website.</li>
<li>It's completely free. Go ahead and distribute and use it as you will.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need to be on Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service Pack 2, Windows 7 Service Pack 1, or Windows 8. 32- or 64-bit versions are all supported. Windows Rt is not supported</li>
<li>The Microsoft .Net Framework 4 Client Version is required, but the installer should take care of all of that for you.</li>
<li>It's signed by Claro Software Ltd - thanks for their support.</li>
<li>If you need help, call me on +44 7983 244 131 or Skype me on Alasdairking. You can email support@webbie.org.uk but you're unlikely to get a response: this isn't my day job!</li>
